## Classifying Fraud in Imbalanced Big Data with Julia

Fraud classification is one of the most challenging problems in machine learning. Frauduland transactions are very minor event
comparing to the legal ones. So, in Big data algorithms shows bias to the Majority events like non-frauduland transactions and 
results in high accuracy but low sensitivity.

In this project, we proposed a majority cluster based undersampling technique incorporating with random-forest classifier, which
leverage the ensemble majority voting technique. This proposed model achieves, 95% accuracy with 99% sensitivity.
